# Predicting-Employee-Attrition

• This project focuses on people analytics methods to predict employee attrition rate using multiple employee characteristics such as their demographics and job status. It helps to determine the best indicators affecting employee attrition and present actionable insights to managerial personas. Our model can be used by the HR department to streamline the recruiting and handoff procedure.

• We built three types of prediction models (logistic regression, random forest, and decision tree), and then compared the results of each. We found out that the logistic regression model performed best and achieved 90% prediction accuracy. Important features such as the time at the company, years of experience, commute distance, overtime logged, and stock options came to light.
